						<h1><b>Frontend Developer,</b></h1>
						<h3>Shopify</h3>
						<p> At Shopify, I worked in the Channels Platform team working on mainly two projects.<br/><br/>

						The first project was building a channel that Shopify merchants can install to integrate their business with Facebook. Various tasks involved include form validation, UI building, and bugfixing. This was completed using React, Apollo, and GraphQL.<br/><br/>

						The second project was leading the improvement of the Buy Button channel's test coverage. The Buy Button is one of the oldest and most used channel in Shopify, but have minimal and oudated tests. My rseponsibility was to create standards, write missing unit tests, and document any discoveries found through the tests. This was completed using Mocha, Sinon, and Chai.

						<h1><b>Web Application Engineer,</b></h1>
						<h3>Taplytics</h3>
						<p> At Taplytics, I first worked on a major project to build a graph editor using D3 within a very strict deadline. The graph editor was used to map out and customize complex user events. Afterwards, I created the user interface for Taplytics' new feature flagging system which includes UI building and form validation. One the feature was shipped to production, I worked on maintaining the current web application, web SDK, and chrome extension. Majority of my time was with React and Redux, with a little time spent with Angularjs.</br></br>

						<h1><b>Fullstack Developer,</b></h1>
						<h3>Sears Initium Commerce Lab</h3>
						<p> During Sears, I worked on four projects. The first project was an internal tool to scrape competitor prices to match. I mainly worked on UI building with Angular in the frontend and Node with Express for the backend. The second project was working on a Spring Camel integration for a new point of sale system to replace legacy infrasturctures. The third project was working within the Netsuite enterprise resource planning system to integrate current processes for supply chain. The last project was to recreate the checkout system of the ecommerce website using React.</br></br>

						<h1><b>eCommerce Developer,</b></h1>
						<h3>Rogers Communications</h3>
						<p> For my second internship, I worked for the largest telecommunications company in Canada, Rogers. I was placed into the Sales and Portals development team which is responsible for working on the website that dealers such as Apple or Best Buy use to sell Rogers services to clients. <br/><br/>

						For majority of my time, I worked in the business as usual (BAU) team which followed the agile software development process using JIRA. I maintained the website through dealing with any bugs, mainly in Java, or implementing new features to the website using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I also introduced bind variables to one of the slower SQL databases to increase efficiency as well as security to the database. Aside from coding, I partcipiated in bi-weekly meetings to plan for sprints and assess current stories, daily scrum meetings to update my progress, and bi-monthly meetings to improve the software development life cycle. <br/><br/>

						I later joined a waterfall project where my task was to take a freshly created web application and apply HTML, CSS, and JavaScript styling to match the brand and identity of Rogers. After completing the styling, I was tasked to create ATG droplets to store user data into a database. </br></br>

						<h1><b>Systems Officer,</b></h1>
						<h3>Office of the Public Guardian and Trustee</h3>
						<p> For my first co-op job, I worked for the government in the Office of the Public Guardian and Trustee, Ministry of the Attorney General. The office delivers a unique and diverse range of services that safeguard the legal, personal and financial interests of the vulnerable. It holds over 400 staff with a widge range of disciplinaries including finance, legal, and client services. <br/><br/>

						For the first two months of the job, I was given a computer refresh project where I had to replace 75 computers throughout the office. The process included setting a 30-minute appointment with the client, transferring important data, installing necessary software applications, and setting up the new computer at their workplace before they arrive back. The busy schedule of tax season made the time especially strict. After the refresh was complete, I was required to document the project's process and any possible improvements. <br/><br/>

						Aside from the computer refresh project, my main task was to serve as the IT service desk and help clients around the office with any of their hardware/software issues. This involved understanding the issue, explaining it in a non-technical manner, and solving it for them. <br/><br/>

						Near the end of the co-op term, my co-op coworker and I were discussing how we can improve the computer refresh project. A large portion was spent manually installing all the programs needed, so we decided to self-start a new project where we develop an automation script using AutoIt to increase efficiency. After completing the scripts, we documented a tutorial on how to use it, and how to create similar scripts in case there may be new software the office needs.
