						<h1><b>eCommerce Developer,</b></h1>
						<h3>Rogers Communications</h3>
						<p> For my second internship, I worked for the largest telecommunications company in Canada, Rogers. I was placed into the Sales and Portals development team which is responsible for working on the website that dealers such as Apple or Best Buy use to sell Rogers services to clients. <br/><br/>

						For majority of my time, I worked in the business as usual (BAU) team which followed the agile software development process using JIRA. I maintained the website through dealing with any bugs, mainly in Java, or implementing new features to the website using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I also introduced bind variables to one of the slower SQL databases to increase efficiency as well as security to the database. Aside from coding, I partcipiated in bi-weekly meetings to plan for sprints and assess current stories, daily scrum meetings to update my progress, and bi-monthly meetings to improve the software development life cycle. <br/><br/>

						I later joined a waterfall project where my task was to take a freshly created web application and apply HTML, CSS, and JavaScript styling to match the brand and identity of Rogers. After completing the styling, I was tasked to create Java servlets to store user data into a database. </br></br>

						Lastly, I participated in the planning of new projects and knowledge transfers. Moreover I was responsible for presenting a 1 hour "lunch-and-learn" on current IT trends to my team. On high-traffic weekends such as the iPhone release and Black Friday, I would arrive to work at 6am and join in on war rooms where managers and tech leads discussed the maintenance of the various Rogers applications.

						<h1><b>Systems Officer,</b></h1>
						<h3>Office of the Public Guardian and Trustee</h3>
						<p> For my first co-op job, I worked for the government in the Office of the Public Guardian and Trustee, Ministry of the Attorney General. The office delivers a unique and diverse range of services that safeguard the legal, personal and financial interests of the vulnerable. It holds over 400 staff with a widge range of disciplinaries including finance, legal, and client services. <br/><br/>

						For the first two months of the job, I was given a computer refresh project where I had to replace 75 computers throughout the office. The process included setting a 30-minute appointment with the client, searching and transferring all important data and files, installing all necessary software applications, and finally setting up the new computer at their workplace before they arrive back. The time was especially strict for accountants because it was tax season and they had an extremely busy schedule. After the refresh was complete, I was required to document the project's process and any possible improvements. <br/><br/>

						Aside from the computer refresh project, my main task was to serve as the IT service desk and help clients around the office with any of their hardware/software issues. I would arrive at their desk, understand their problem and explain the solution in a simple non-technical manner, execute it, and then document the solution for future queries. This task was completed throughout all 4 months of the internship. Other small tasks included testing out new software and documenting its installation process and how to use it. <br/><br/>

						Near the end of the co-op term, my co-op coworker and I were discussing how we can improve the computer refresh project. A large portion was spent manually installing all the programs needed, so we decided to self-start a new project where we develop an automation script using AutoIt to increase efficiency. After completing the scripts, we documented a tutorial on how to use it, and how to create similar scripts in case there may be new software the office needs.
