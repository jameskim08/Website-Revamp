						<h1><b>eCommerce Developer,</b></h1>
						<h3>Rogers Communications</h3>
						<p> For my second internship, I worked for the largest telecommunications company in Canada, Rogers. I was placed into the Sales and Portals development team which is responsible for working on the website that dealers such as Apple or Best Buy use to sell Rogers services to clients. <br/><br/>

						For majority of my time, I worked in the business as usual (BAU) team which followed the agile software development process using JIRA. I maintained the website through dealing with any bugs, mainly in Java, or implementing new features to the website using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I also introduced bind variables to one of the slower SQL databases to increase efficiency as well as security to the database. Aside from coding, I partcipiated in bi-weekly meetings to plan for sprints and assess current stories, daily scrum meetings to update my progress, and bi-monthly meetings to improve the software development life cycle. <br/><br/>

						I later joined a waterfall project where my task was to take a freshly created web application and apply HTML, CSS, and JavaScript styling to match the brand and identity of Rogers. After completing the styling, I was tasked to create Java servlets to store user data into a database. </br></br>

						<h1><b>Systems Officer,</b></h1>
						<h3>Office of the Public Guardian and Trustee</h3>
						<p> For my first co-op job, I worked for the government in the Office of the Public Guardian and Trustee, Ministry of the Attorney General. The office delivers a unique and diverse range of services that safeguard the legal, personal and financial interests of the vulnerable. It holds over 400 staff with a widge range of disciplinaries including finance, legal, and client services. <br/><br/>

						For the first two months of the job, I was given a computer refresh project where I had to replace 75 computers throughout the office. The process included setting a 30-minute appointment with the client, transferring important data, installing necessary software applications, and setting up the new computer at their workplace before they arrive back. The busy schedule of tax season made the time especially strict. After the refresh was complete, I was required to document the project's process and any possible improvements. <br/><br/>

						Aside from the computer refresh project, my main task was to serve as the IT service desk and help clients around the office with any of their hardware/software issues. This involved understanding the issue, explaining it in a non-technical manner, and solving it for them. <br/><br/>

						Near the end of the co-op term, my co-op coworker and I were discussing how we can improve the computer refresh project. A large portion was spent manually installing all the programs needed, so we decided to self-start a new project where we develop an automation script using AutoIt to increase efficiency. After completing the scripts, we documented a tutorial on how to use it, and how to create similar scripts in case there may be new software the office needs.

						<h1><b>Course Organizer</b></h1>

							<p>Angular2, TypeScript, WebStorm <br/><br/>
							To learn Angular, I followed the tutorial, "Tour of Heroes", on the Angular2 website but added more depth by implementing new features to create a new application, a course organizer. During the process, I also learned how to use Github and created documentation for each enhancement stating its functionality and requirements. The application uses multiple components, routing, services, and HTTP calls.

							<p>Android Studio, Java, XML, libGDX <br/><br/>
							Flappy bird was created using Android Studio and the framework, libGDX. It involved coding the physics of the bird, animation, detecting hitbox, and a scoring system.

						<h1><b>Website Portfolio</b></h1>
						<div class="content">
							<img src="img/website-portfolio.PNG" alt="Website Portfolio Mobile"></img>
							<p>JavaScript, JQuery, HTML, CSS <br/><br/>
							I first coded my website in my first year of university to teach myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. However, the first design was difficult to maintain and the code was difficult to read. <br/><br/>

							In order to improve the website, I collaborated with a designer to revamp the website into one that focuses on usability with a simple and clean design. I also refined my code by making it easy to read, maintain, and implement features to. The site is both desktop and mobile friendly and uses JQuery for simple animations to add flow.
